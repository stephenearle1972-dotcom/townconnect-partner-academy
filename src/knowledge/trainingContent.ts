## SECTION 1: ABOUT TOWNCONNECT

### What is TownConnect?
TownConnect is a WhatsApp-first hyperlocal business directory serving small South African towns and urban neighbourhoods. It combines a branded website with an AI-powered WhatsApp bot that lets locals find businesses instantly by typing what they need (e.g., "plumber" or "restaurant").

### Why WhatsApp-First?
South Africans prefer WhatsApp over websites for finding local services. Data costs make browsing websites expensive, but WhatsApp messages are often free or very cheap. People already use WhatsApp daily and trust it.

### Languages Supported
The WhatsApp bot supports English, Afrikaans, and Sepedi. The bot auto-detects the user's language and responds in the same language. This is important for Limpopo towns (Sepedi is widely spoken) and Western Cape/Afrikaans communities.

### Current Scale (February 2026)
TownConnect operates 11 live sites across 6 provinces. All sites deploy from one shared codebase (multi-tenant architecture). Each town has its own Google Sheet for business listings.

**Live Towns:**
| Town | Region | WhatsApp Bot | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Vaalwater | Limpopo | Active | Flagship site, custom domain vaalwaterconnect.co.za |
| Menlyn | Gauteng | Active | Pretoria East |
| Port Alfred | Eastern Cape | Active (Deirdre's number) | Operator: Deirdre Simpson |

---

## SECTION 4: PAYMENTS AND REVENUE

### How Payments Work
- TownConnect uses **PayFast** for online payments
- Businesses can pay via the town website's pricing page
- Payment options: Credit/debit card, EFT, Instant EFT
- Area Partners can also collect cash (see Cash Handling Rules)

### Revenue Split
50/50 on NET revenue (after PayFast ~3.5% fee)

### Revenue Split Calculation Example
- Business pays R199/month
- PayFast takes approximately 3.5% + R2 per transaction ≈ R9
- Net revenue: approximately R190
- Area Partner gets 50%: approximately R95
- TownConnect gets 50%: approximately R95

**Important:** The 50/50 split is on NET revenue (after payment processing fees), not on the gross amount.

### Payment Methods
1. Card via PayFast on website (preferred)
2. EFT to TownConnect account
3. Cash collected by partner (48-hour deposit rule)

### Banking Details
Bank: FNB
Account Name: SP Earle
Account Number: 63055696604
Reference: [town]-[businessname]

### 48-Hour Cash Rule
ALL cash collected must be deposited within 48 hours. This is mandatory - failure is a material breach that can result in termination.

### Monthly Payment Timeline
- By 5th: TownConnect sends your statement
- Within 48 hours: Raise any queries
- By 7th: TownConnect pays your share

### Refunds
Never promise without TownConnect approval. Refunds are shared 50/50.

---

## SECTION 5: SALES TECHNIQUES

### Most Effective Method
On-foot visits. Walk into businesses, give 30-second pitch, do live demo.

**Vaalwater Case Study (October 2025):** 35 businesses approached on foot showed interest at R200/month. Actual results vary by town, approach method, and local market conditions.

### The 30-Second Pitch
"Hi, I'm [Name] from [Town]Connect. We're building the local WhatsApp business directory. When someone types 'plumber' or '[their service]' into our bot, your business shows up instantly. Unlike Facebook where people scroll, our users are actively looking. It's R[X] per month. Can I show you how it works?"

### The Live Demo (Most Powerful Tool)
1. Pull out your phone
2. Open WhatsApp, message the bot number
3. Type a category (e.g., "restaurant")
4. Show instant results
5. Search THEIR category - either they appear or "You could be first!"
6. Let them try it themselves

### The "List First, Ask Later" Approach
This has been tested and achieves nearly 100% interest rates:
1. Walk into a business and say: "Hi, I'm [name] from [Town]Connect. We're building a free online directory for [Town]. Can I add your business? Just need your name, what you do, and a phone number."
2. They say yes (almost always — it's free and takes 30 seconds)
3. You add them as a basic listing immediately
4. Follow up 1-2 days later: "Your business is now live on [Town]Connect — here's the link. Hundreds of locals are already using it. Want to upgrade to a full listing with photos and WhatsApp link for just R199/month?"

**Why it works:** You're giving value FIRST. No one says no to a free listing. The upgrade conversation is easy because they can already see their business on the site.

### WhatsApp Bot Demo Script
When pitching to a business owner:
1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Send a message to the bot: "[their service type]" (e.g., "plumber" or "restaurant")
3. Show them the response
4. Say: "This is how your customers find you. Right now when someone in [Town] searches for [their service], they see your competitors. Let's get you listed."

### Expected Results
On-foot: 6-10 interested businesses per hour
Cold WhatsApp: 2-4 responses per hour

---

## SECTION 6: SALES SCRIPTS

### Cold Visit Script
"Hi, I'm [Name] from [Town]Connect. We're building the local WhatsApp business directory for [Town]. When someone types 'plumber' or '[their service]' into our WhatsApp bot, your business shows up instantly. Unlike Facebook where people just scroll, our users are actively looking for your service right now. It's R[X] per month. Can I show you how it works?"

### Cold WhatsApp Message
"Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name] from [Town]Connect - the local WhatsApp business directory.

I'd like to add [Business Name] so locals can find you instantly when they need [their service].

Can I send you more info?

[Your Name]
[Your Number]

If you're not interested, just reply 'no' and I won't message again."

### Payment Request Script
"Great! Here are the payment details:

Amount: R[X]/month or R[Annual]/year (save 2 months)

Option 1 - Pay online:
[website URL]/#pricing

Option 2 - EFT:
Bank: FNB
Account: SP Earle
Number: 63055696604
Reference: [town]-[businessname]

Once payment reflects, I'll upgrade your listing to the full package.

Send me proof of payment when done."

### Payment Received Script
"Payment received - thank you!

[Business Name] is now fully active on [Town]Connect:

WhatsApp bot: [Bot Number]
Your page: [website URL]/#directory
Map: [website URL]/#map

Feel free to share the WhatsApp link with your customers.

Any updates needed, just let me know."

### No Response Follow-Up (3-5 Days)
"Hi [Name], just following up on [Town]Connect.

Happy to answer any questions about the listing. Most local businesses find the WhatsApp visibility really valuable.

Let me know if you'd like to chat.

If you're not interested, just reply 'no' and I won't message again."

### Graceful Decline Response
"No problem at all - thanks for letting me know.

If things change or you'd like to try it later, the offer stands.

All the best with [Business Name]!"

---

## SECTION 7: OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive" / "R199 is too much"
"I understand budget is important. Let me ask - would just ONE new customer per month be worth R[X]? Most businesses tell me one job covers the whole year's subscription."

Additional responses:
- "That's less than R7 per day. If you get just ONE new customer from the directory, it pays for itself. Most businesses get several."
- "You can start with the Standard plan and upgrade later when you see results."
- "We also offer annual billing — you get one month free, which brings it down to about R182/month."

### "I'm already on Google/Facebook"
"That's great for people who search there. But think about it - when someone posts in a WhatsApp group asking 'does anyone know a good [service]?', they're not opening Google. They're asking their community. That's where we show up."

### "I don't need online marketing" / "I don't need advertising"
"Your customers are already searching on WhatsApp. We're just making sure they find YOU instead of someone else."
"94% of South Africans with smartphones use WhatsApp daily. That's where your customers are looking."
"This isn't advertising - it's visibility. When your neighbour asks in the community group 'who knows a good [service]?', wouldn't you want to be the answer that pops up instantly?"

### "Nobody uses WhatsApp for this"
"Let me show you..." [Do live demo] "See? In 3 seconds, they have your number. No scrolling, no ads, no distractions."

### "My nephew does my marketing"
"Perfect - this actually makes his job easier. When he posts about your business, people can find you instantly instead of scrolling through comments."

### "Let me think about it"
"Absolutely. While you think, let me add your basic details so you can see how it looks. If you decide it's not for you, I'll remove it - no charge. Fair?"

### "Business is slow right now"
"That's exactly why visibility matters most right now. When things are slow, you need every potential customer to find you. The businesses that stay visible during quiet times are the ones that recover fastest."

## SECTION 8: WHATSAPP GROUP MARKETING

### Golden Rule
Be a genuine community member first, marketer second.

### DO:
- Introduce yourself personally when joining
- Help with recommendations (even competitors) before promoting
- Use branded images with posts
- Respond to enquiries within the group
- Space promotional posts at least 7 days apart

### DON'T:
- Post same message in multiple groups within 24 hours
- Send bulk promotional messages (illegal under ECTA)
- Post text-only messages with links (looks like spam)
- Tag people without permission
- Argue with critics

### Responding to "Does Anyone Know..." Posts
1. Answer their question directly first
2. Give a specific recommendation with contact
3. Only then mention the directory briefly

Example:
"I can recommend Johan at Spark Electrical - 082 XXX XXXX. He did great work at my place.

If you need more options, our local directory has a few others: save 072 XXX XXXX and send 'electrician'."

---

## SECTION 9: WHATSAPP BOT FEATURES

### How the Bot Works
- Bot searches the town's business listings database
- Returns matching businesses with name, description, phone number, WhatsApp link, and website link
- If no match found: "No [service] listed in [Town] yet. If you know this business, please share their details."
- Bot NEVER invents businesses — only returns what's in the database

### Photo Responses for Premium Listings
- Premium and Enterprise tier businesses can now have their photos displayed directly in WhatsApp bot responses
- When a user searches for a service, matching premium businesses show their photo alongside contact details
- This is a strong upsell point: "Upgrade to Premium and your business photo appears when people search on WhatsApp"

### Trilingual Support
- All bots support English, Afrikaans, and Sepedi
- The bot auto-detects the user's language and responds in the same language
- This is important for Limpopo towns (Sepedi is widely spoken) and Western Cape/Afrikaans communities

---

## SECTION 10: CLUBS & ORGANIZATIONS (NEW — February 2026)

Every TownConnect site now includes a **Clubs & Organizations** directory alongside business listings. This is a FREE feature — clubs and organizations are listed at no charge.

### What it includes
Sports clubs, hobby groups, religious organizations, community groups, NGOs, school PTAs, etc. Each listing shows: name, description, contact details, meeting times/location.

### How to add a club/organization
Same process as adding a business listing, but in the Clubs & Organizations section of the Google Sheet. Partners can submit club info to Stephen for adding, or use the submission form on their town's website.

### Why it matters for partners
Partners should actively collect club/organization info during their community outreach — it builds goodwill and makes the site more valuable to residents.

### Sales angle
"We also list all local clubs and organizations for free — this makes our site THE place residents check for community info." Builds community trust and drives traffic, which benefits paying business listings.

## SECTION 11: HIRING AND MANAGING SALES REPS

### When to Hire a Rep
- Once your town site has 20+ listings and steady subscription revenue
- When you can't personally cover all the businesses in your territory
- When you want to grow faster without doing all the legwork yourself

### How Reps Work
- TownConnect provides an Independent Sales Rep Agreement template
- Reps work as independent contractors (NOT employees)
- They earn commission on businesses they sign up — paid by the Area Partner from the partner's 50% share
- Rep commissions are a cost to the Area Partner, not to TownConnect

### Recommended Commission Structure
- **50% of first month's revenue** (strong incentive to close)
- **40% of months 2-6** (rewards retention)
- **30% ongoing from month 7** (trailing commission for as long as the business stays subscribed)
- These are recommendations — partners can negotiate different rates with their reps

### Cash Handling Rules (CRITICAL)
If your reps collect cash payments from businesses:
- **Maximum R2,000 cash per transaction** — anything over must be EFT or card
- Reps MUST use official TownConnect receipt books (3-part: business copy, partner copy, TownConnect copy)
- Reps must photograph every receipt and send the photo to you within 24 hours
- Cash must be deposited into the designated account within 48 hours
- Weekly reconciliation: match receipt book stubs against deposits
- Any cash shortfall is the rep's personal liability

### KYC (Know Your Contractor) Requirements
Before a rep can start, you must collect and verify:
1. **Certified copy of their ID or passport** — confirms identity
2. **Proof of address** (utility bill or bank statement, less than 3 months old) — confirms where they live
3. **Bank confirmation letter** — verifies the account where you'll pay commissions
4. **SARS tax number** — confirms they're tax-registered (required for independent contractors)
5. **VAT number** (only if they're VAT-registered, which is above R1 million turnover)
6. **Selfie holding their ID** — remote identity verification (standard practice in South Africa)
7. **Signed Independent Sales Rep Agreement**

**Why this matters:** You're giving reps receipt books and trusting them to collect money on your behalf. If a rep disappears with cash and you don't have verified ID and address, you have no way to recover the funds. KYC protects you and your business.

### Rep Red Flags — Watch Out For
- Rep delays submitting receipt photos or depositing cash
- Businesses complain they paid but the rep didn't process it
- Rep makes promises to businesses that aren't in the package (e.g., "unlimited photos" on Standard tier)
- Rep operates outside their assigned area
- Any of these should trigger an immediate conversation and possible termination

---

## SECTION 12: TERRITORY TRANSITION

If TownConnect has been using a rep to sign up businesses in a town, and then an Area Partner is appointed for that same territory, this is the process:

### 5-Step Transition Process
1. **Written notice** — TownConnect gives the rep 30 days' written notice that an Area Partner has been appointed
2. **Handover period** — Rep continues earning commission on existing signed businesses during the notice period
3. **Client transfer** — All business relationships transfer to the new Area Partner on the effective date
4. **Trailing commission preserved** — The rep continues to earn their trailing commission on businesses THEY personally signed, even after the territory transfers. This is paid by TownConnect, not the new Area Partner
5. **New territory options** — TownConnect offers the rep alternative territories where no Area Partner exists yet

**Key point for Area Partners:** If you're appointed to a territory where a TownConnect rep has already been active, you inherit their signed businesses. The rep keeps their trailing commission on those businesses (paid by TownConnect centrally), but going forward you manage all relationships and earn your 50% on all revenue from day one.
