## SECTION 1: ABOUT TOWNCONNECT

### What is TownConnect?
TownConnect is a WhatsApp-first hyperlocal business directory serving small South African towns and urban neighbourhoods. It combines a branded website with an AI-powered WhatsApp bot that lets locals find businesses instantly by typing what they need (e.g., "plumber" or "restaurant").

### Why WhatsApp-First?
South Africans prefer WhatsApp over websites for finding local services. Data costs make browsing websites expensive, but WhatsApp messages are often free or very cheap. People already use WhatsApp daily and trust it.

### Languages Supported
The WhatsApp bot supports English, Afrikaans, and Sepedi. Users can search in any of these languages.

## SECTION 5: SALES TECHNIQUES

### Most Effective Method
On-foot visits. Walk into businesses, give 30-second pitch, do live demo.

**Vaalwater Case Study (October 2025):** 35 businesses approached on foot showed interest at R200/month. Actual results vary by town, approach method, and local market conditions.

### The 30-Second Pitch
"Hi, I'm [Name] from [Town]Connect. We're building the local WhatsApp business directory. When someone types 'plumber' or '[their service]' into our bot, your business shows up instantly. Unlike Facebook where people scroll, our users are actively looking. It's R[X] per month. Can I show you how it works?"

### The Live Demo (Most Powerful Tool)
1. Pull out your phone
2. Open WhatsApp, message the bot number
3. Type a category (e.g., "restaurant")
4. Show instant results
5. Search THEIR category - either they appear or "You could be first!"
6. Let them try it themselves

### "List First, Ask Later" Strategy
Add interested businesses for free initially. Let them see their listing live. Then follow up for payment. This removes risk and proves value.

### Expected Results
On-foot: 6-10 interested businesses per hour
Cold WhatsApp: 2-4 responses per hour

## SECTION 6: SALES SCRIPTS

### Cold Visit Script
"Hi, I'm [Name] from [Town]Connect. We're building the local WhatsApp business directory for [Town]. When someone types 'plumber' or '[their service]' into our WhatsApp bot, your business shows up instantly. Unlike Facebook where people just scroll, our users are actively looking for your service right now. It's R[X] per month. Can I show you how it works?"

### Cold WhatsApp Message
"Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name] from [Town]Connect - the local WhatsApp business directory.

I'd like to add [Business Name] so locals can find you instantly when they need [their service].

Can I send you more info?

[Your Name]
[Your Number]

If you're not interested, just reply 'no' and I won't message again."

### Payment Request Script
"Great! Here are the payment details:

Amount: R[X]/month or R[Annual]/year (save 2 months)

Option 1 - Pay online:
[website URL]/#pricing

Option 2 - EFT:
Bank: FNB
Account: SP Earle
Number: 63055696604
Reference: [town]-[businessname]

Once payment reflects, I'll upgrade your listing to the full package.

Send me proof of payment when done."

### Payment Received Script
"Payment received - thank you!

[Business Name] is now fully active on [Town]Connect:

WhatsApp bot: [Bot Number]
Your page: [website URL]/#directory
Map: [website URL]/#map

Feel free to share the WhatsApp link with your customers.

Any updates needed, just let me know."

### No Response Follow-Up (3-5 Days)
"Hi [Name], just following up on [Town]Connect.

Happy to answer any questions about the listing. Most local businesses find the WhatsApp visibility really valuable.

Let me know if you'd like to chat.

If you're not interested, just reply 'no' and I won't message again."

### Graceful Decline Response
"No problem at all - thanks for letting me know.

If things change or you'd like to try it later, the offer stands.

All the best with [Business Name]!"

---

## SECTION 7: OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive"
"I understand budget is important. Let me ask - would just ONE new customer per month be worth R[X]? Most businesses tell me one job covers the whole year's subscription."

### "I'm already on Google/Facebook"
"That's great for people who search there. But think about it - when someone posts in a WhatsApp group asking 'does anyone know a good [service]?', they're not opening Google. They're asking their community. That's where we show up."

### "Nobody uses WhatsApp for this"
"Let me show you..." [Do live demo] "See? In 3 seconds, they have your number. No scrolling, no ads, no distractions."

### "I don't need advertising"
"This isn't advertising - it's visibility. When your neighbour asks in the community group 'who knows a good [service]?', wouldn't you want to be the answer that pops up instantly?"

### "My nephew does my marketing"
"Perfect - this actually makes his job easier. When he posts about your business, people can find you instantly instead of scrolling through comments."

### "Let me think about it"
"Absolutely. While you think, let me add your basic details so you can see how it looks. If you decide it's not for you, I'll remove it - no charge. Fair?"

### "Business is slow right now"
"That's exactly why visibility matters most right now. When things are slow, you need every potential customer to find you. The businesses that stay visible during quiet times are the ones that recover fastest."

## SECTION 8: WHATSAPP GROUP MARKETING

### Golden Rule
Be a genuine community member first, marketer second.

### DO:
- Introduce yourself personally when joining
- Help with recommendations (even competitors) before promoting
- Use branded images with posts
- Respond to enquiries within the group
- Space promotional posts at least 7 days apart

### DON'T:
- Post same message in multiple groups within 24 hours
- Send bulk promotional messages (illegal under ECTA)
- Post text-only messages with links (looks like spam)
- Tag people without permission
- Argue with critics

### Responding to "Does Anyone Know..." Posts
1. Answer their question directly first
2. Give a specific recommendation with contact
3. Only then mention the directory briefly

Example:
"I can recommend Johan at Spark Electrical - 082 XXX XXXX. He did great work at my place.

If you need more options, our local directory has a few others: save 072 XXX XXXX and send 'electrician'."
